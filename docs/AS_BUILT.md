# As Built

The living record of what is **actually implemented**, as opposed to what is planned
(`docs/file-explorer-plan.md`). Every PR that changes code must update this file —
the quality gate (`scripts/gate.sh`) and CI enforce it.

How to update: add or amend the relevant component section below, and add a row to the
change log. Record what exists, how it deviates from the plan (and why), and any known
limitations. Keep it truthful — this file is only useful if it matches the code.

## Status

**Current milestone:** M0 in progress — cargo workspace exists with a minimal
GPUI window skeleton and visual regression test infrastructure.

## Components

### Workspace / build tooling
- Quality gate (`scripts/gate.sh`), Claude Code hooks (`.claude/settings.json`),
  CI (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`), branch protection script
  (`scripts/setup-branch-protection.sh`).
- Cargo workspace (edition 2024, toolchain pinned to 1.97.1) with `crates/app`.
  gpui + gpui_platform pinned to zed rev `fd82517a` (needed for
  `VisualTestAppContext`).

### app (GPUI)
- `WorkspaceView`: static M0 skeleton of the reference layout — titlebar,
  sidebar (Devices/Favorites/Tags placeholders), main pane with status line,
  info panel. No interactivity yet.
- `theme` module: hard-coded dark + light palettes (`Theme::dark()/light()`);
  the JSON theme system replaces this at M7.
- **Visual regression tests**: `visual_test_runner` binary (feature
  `visual-tests`, macOS-only at runtime) renders `WorkspaceView` off-screen via
  `gpui::VisualTestAppContext`, captures Metal-rendered screenshots, compares
  against baselines in `crates/app/test_fixtures/visual_tests/` (≥99% match,
  channel tolerance 3, union-canvas so size changes always fail). Pixel-diff
  logic in `visual_diff` module is platform-independent and unit-tested.
  Scenarios: `workspace_dark`, `workspace_light`.
- CI: `Visual regression tests (macOS)` job runs the comparison per PR;
  `update-visual-baselines.yml` (manual dispatch, non-main branches) regenerates
  baselines on the same runner image and commits them to the branch.

### fs-core
- Not started.

### theme (crate)
- Not started (interim `theme` module lives inside `crates/app`).

### Architecture (Phase A)
- `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` — the entity/module blueprint for M1–M8, produced by an
  orchestrated workflow (4 source-research agents over Zed @ pinned rev,
  gpui-component, adabraka-ui → 3 independent drafts → 3-judge panel →
  synthesis). Contains the behavior→action traceability table (source of truth
  for `keymap.rs`), entity graph, data-flow diagrams, threading model, fs-core
  internals, widget build-list, testing map, and per-milestone build order.
- `.claude/agents/` — Orchestrator/Proposer/Critic/Builder/Reviewer agent pack
  used to drive milestone workflows (Phase B).
- `docs/KICKOFF_PROMPT.md` — the standing build directive for new sessions.

## Deviations from the plan

- Theme lives as a module in `crates/app` instead of its own crate until the
  JSON theme system lands (M7); the plan's crate split is deferred to avoid a
  near-empty crate.
- Visual regression testing (not explicitly in the plan's testing section) was
  added ahead of M1, modeled on Zed's visual test runner.
- **gpui-component is NOT adopted**, overturning plan §4: it floats on zed main
  (no rev pin) which conflicts structurally with our `fd82517a` pin (required by
  `VisualTestAppContext`), its dialogs/menus demand an all-or-nothing `Root`
  runtime, and it drags heavy deps. Instead: ~6 hand-built widgets on gpui
  primitives + adabraka-ui's MIT text input vendored via `crates/app/VENDORED.md`.
  Full rationale and revisit conditions: ARCHITECTURE.md §7. Plan §4 amendment
  pending.
